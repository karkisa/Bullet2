# Bullet2

This Git Repo implements the server and client as containers. Connect them and run an end to end client server network.

We use Rust for client 
and 
Python for creating a server


The docker-compose.yml file does the heavy lifting and creates the server and client containers and connects them.

To use this repo 
#

git clone this_repo_url
#
docker-compose build
#
docker-compose up
#


and viola 
#

You have the information that the client recieves from the server on your terminal


Done!!
